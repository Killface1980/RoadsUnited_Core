Unlawful:
Going to make some heavy revisons in the core mod file.
   I finally finished the damn texture maps. Back to fun times.

   New texture naming convention, will eliminate any confusion with regards to texture generation abd
also combine NExt roads with the rest to make things easier. The if(x.exists(yyy.zzz)) checks take care of that.
This came about as a need to mass produce textures with simple names. Real  keyboard macros and the 
Bulk Renaming Utility.

I don't see a need for new naming conventions. This mod was designed to replace the vanilla textures by name 1:1, with only exceptions made to extras added by the mod. Exceptions shouldn't become the standard. I have reworked all my PSD files which I was planing to use as a base for future texture packs to automatically generate all graphics needed - which works perfectly. There is no need for me to fiddle manually with the file names and risk faulty replacements.

I'll upload a csv to explain the conventions, bottomline is that all the names are consistant.

If it's helping, then any changes are welcome.

American Roads Version:
   - New Mod Name: American Infrastructure

Planned Updates
    -Replacing individual textures on segments to allow "true" turning lanes (NExt roads) w/ solid lines.

I've been keeping quiet about it, but if you look at my imgur posts, you will see my American styled traffic lights. Using his mod alongside would allow for true awesomeness and a whole new level of realism (graphics wise). //KF: they look really cool, but have no experience with assets. 

Killface:  
- Getting rid of segment.lod render distance = -1 and implement real lod textures by default
- adding optional tooltip textures for the texture packs
- multiple crossings per option; might be solved by "for each ...node_int (...node_1.dds, node_2.dds) dropdown add x - can also apply to ..._parking1
